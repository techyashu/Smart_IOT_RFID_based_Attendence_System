# Smart_IOT_RFID_based_Attendence_System
This project uses RFID technology to make a note of every student entering into the classroom and also to calculate the time resides in the class. In this proposed system, every student is allotted with an RFID tag. The process of attendance can be done by placing the card near the RFID reader and not only this but I have introduced some more functions in this project.
